p1:

This exercise solves a PVI by the Euler method (explicit) and by the method
of Runge-Kutta, it was also given the exact function to compare and plots in the same
graphic.

p2:

Basic description of the first question: 

This exercise solves an IVP by the Runge-Kutta method and to animate the block and the spring of the damped mass-spring.
 
Below is a list of features and description:
  Given the PVI defined below:
	 x '= v
	 v' = - (k * x) / m + (k * L) / m - (alpha * v) / m * 
	Where alpha = 0.5

Basic description of the second question:
 
This exercise solves a PVI by the Runge-Kutta method and to animate the ball (circle) of the pendulum and the pendulum rod of the simple pendulum with cushioning.
 
Below is a list of features and description:
 
 Given the PVI defined below: 
	tetha ’= w 
	w’ = - (g / L) * sin (tetha) -alfha * tetha ’* 
	where alpha = 0.5

Basic description of the third question:
 
This exercise to solves a single ODE of the RC.A circuit using the simple Runge-Kutta method and plot the graphs of the capacitor charge, luster at the capacitor terminals, 
voltage at the resistor terminals and lastly the voltage of the source (constant)
 
Below is a list of features and description:
 
 Given the ODE defined below: 
	q ’= (V / R) - ((1 * q) / R * C)
 
 	Where, V source = 10, C = 0.000001, R = 2.00, T = 6 * R * C, Vcapacitor = q / C, Vresistor = VF-VC
